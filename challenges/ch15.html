			<p>
				I’m really grateful to have you in my life. I never thought I
				could ever have such a genuine sibling-like bond with someone I
				only met last year—especially during one of the worst times of
				my life. I honestly feel like the luckiest person in the world
				to have you as my friend, my brother, or whatever you’d like to
				call it. I know deep down that you genuinely care for me, and
				that’s something truly rare. Of course, the feeling is mutual.
				You put in so much effort, and I really appreciate it—thank you
				for pushing me, for being there, for supporting me through
				things like NIMCET, and for so many other things I never got
				around to saying. I just can’t stop flexing about it—because at
				least now, I have one genuine friend I can proudly talk about. I
				was even talking to Vaibhav today, and I ended up bragging about
				you in front of him too. You matter to me, and I really hope our
				bond stays the same. Right now, this is the only truly pure bond
				I have, and I treasure it.
